# Python Open Source Sprints

## What are Python Open Source Sprints?
Open source software, including Python and most Python libraries, is developed as a joint effort of thousands of programmers. Programmers like you spend time contributing to documentation, tests, bug fixes, and new features. It's a wonderful opportunity for you to contribute in a guided way to the Python library you use.

## Can I participate if I have never contributed to open source?
Sure. Anyone with some Python knowledge is welcome to participate. PyLadies Amsterdam and Picnic mentors will guide you through.

## Python libraries to contribute to 
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - machine learning in Python

[transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) - state-of-the-art Machine Learning for Pytorch, TensorFlow, and JAX

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - flexible and powerful data analysis/manipulation library for Python

[numpy](https://numpy.org/) - the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python

[dbt-core](https://www.getdbt.com/product/what-is-dbt) - dbt enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production

*Bonus Python library*

[diepvries](https://diepvries.picnic.tech/) - The Picnic Data Vault framework
